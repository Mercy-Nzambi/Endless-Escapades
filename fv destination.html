    <h2>A VISIT TO LAKE NAKURU</h2>

   <p>  That day early in the morning my friend and i woke up early to prepare ourselves for the journey.
        Everything seemed normal until we boarded our jeep and embarked on a beautiful trip to lake nakuru.
        The moment our eyes flashed across the lake, we were blown off the beautiful sight of the lake and the 
        colourful flamingos.We stayed the whole day watching the beautiful birds as they took off and others landed 
        sliding on the surface of the water.We recorded and took beautiful photos of the birds.</p>
